BossNotifier Two-DLL Architecture
==================================

The mod is split into two assemblies to support optional Fika integration:

1. BossNotifier.dll - Main plugin with no Fika dependencies, works standalone in singleplayer
2. BossNotifier.FikaOptional.dll.bin - Fika integration loaded conditionally when Fika.Core is present

The .bin extension prevents BepInEx from auto-loading it. The main plugin loads it via Assembly.LoadFrom()
only when Fika is detected, ensuring no errors occur when Fika is absent. This approach eliminates the need
for complex reflection throughout the Fika integration code - FikaIntegration.cs uses direct references.

Build: Use build.ps1 (handles build order and ensures .bin is packaged in zip)
